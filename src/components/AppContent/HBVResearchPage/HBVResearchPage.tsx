                        The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a chronic liver disease that, once manifested, is untreatable,
                        leading to liver cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. HBV is a silent killer; patients are
                        largely asymptomatic, and when symptoms do manifest, it is often too late for treatment to be
                        effective. Fortunately, HBV is not as easily transmissible like COVID-19, being passed only
                        through birth (mother to child), blood (direct contact with infected blood), or unprotected sex
                        with someone with HBV. Hepatitis B is also preventable; there exists a vaccine that can
                        effectively prevent the onset of Hepatitis B. Despite these advantages, there exists 257 million
                        people infected with HBV. Compared to AIDS, where there are estimated to be 38 million people
                        infected, there are about 7x more people with HBV. Yet, there is so much more media coverage and
                        efforts directed towards fighting AIDS, while there is almost none than preventing HBV. In the
                        United States of America, 1 in 12 Asians are infected with HBV as opposed to 1 in 1000
                        non-Hispanic Caucasians, and Asian Americans comprise more than half of the 1.2 - 2 million
                        individuals infected with HBV. HBV is one of the greatest racial health disparities in the US.

                        In middle school, my maternal grandmother passed away from Hepatitis B. Through that experience,
                        I took a youth leadership course at the Stanford Asian Liver Center, an organization that raises
                        awareness about the deadliness of HBV and the disproportionate amount of individuals affected by
                        HBV not only in the world, but also Asians affected by HBV in the US. Inspired by the
                        opportunity to save others from the horrible suffering my grandmother went through simply by
                        advocating for screening and vaccination, I joined Team HBV, the high school and collegiate
                        outreach arm of the Stanford Asian Liver Center. While I was unable to start a chapter at my own
                        high school, I often volunteered on my own, meeting members from other chapters of Team HBV.
                        When I attended college at UCSD, I was presented with the opportunity to help lead the Team HBV
                        chapter there, and decided to partner with the Asian Pacific Health Foundation, a local health
                        organization that provided Hepatitis B screenings and vaccinations to Asian populations across
                        San Diego. Working alongside the Asian Pacific Health Foundation provided me with unique
                        opportunities to perform undergraduate research with them.
